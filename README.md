# Building-your-Deep-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step
Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step


Welcome to your week 4 assignment (part 1 of 2)! You have previously trained a 2-layer Neural Network (with a single hidden layer). This week, you will build a deep neural network, with as many layers as you want!

    In this notebook, you will implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network.
    In the next assignment, you will use these functions to build a deep neural network for image classification.

After this assignment you will be able to:

    Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
    Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
    Implement an easy-to-use neural network class

Notation:

    Superscript [l][l] denotes a quantity associated with the lthlth layer.
        Example: a[L]a[L] is the LthLth layer activation. W[L]W[L] and b[L]b[L] are the LthLth layer parameters.
    Superscript (i)(i) denotes a quantity associated with the ithith example.
        Example: x(i)x(i) is the ithith training example.
    Lowerscript ii denotes the ithith entry of a vector.
        Example: a[l]iai[l] denotes the ithith entry of the lthlth layer's activations).

Let's get started!
